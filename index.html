                <h2 class="flower-name">Buttercup</h2>
                <p class="description">The buttercup is a bright, cheerful flower from the Ranunculus genus, known for its shiny, yellow petals and simple charm. Often found in meadows and fields, it symbolizes childlike joy, innocence, and humility, but can also represent unrequited love or ingratitude in older folklore. Despite its sweet appearance, many buttercup species are mildly toxic. With its sun-like glow and playful associations—like holding one under the chin to "see if you like butter"—the buttercup is a nostalgic symbol of carefree youth and natural beauty.</p>

                <p class="description">The bluebell is a delicate, bell-shaped flower known for its striking violet-blue color and its carpet-like blooms in spring woodlands. Belonging to the Hyacinthoides genus, it symbolizes humility, gratitude, and everlasting love. In folklore, bluebells are often linked to fairy magic and mystery, said to summon enchantment or mark hidden realms. Though beautiful, they’re also a protected species in some regions due to their rarity. With their graceful nodding heads and enchanting presence, bluebells evoke a sense of quiet wonder and deep emotional connection to nature</p>

Often associated with love, devotion, and admiration, its meaning shifts with color: red for deep love, white for purity and remembrance, pink for gratitude (and often linked to a mother’s love), and yellow for disappointment or rejection. With roots in ancient Greece and Christian legend, carnations are widely used in ceremonies and celebrations around the world. Their elegance and emotional depth make them a favorite for expressing heartfelt sentiments.</p>
